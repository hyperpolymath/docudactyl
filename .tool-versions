# Docudactyl HPC — Pinned tool versions (asdf)
#
# These versions are tested and known to work with the current codebase.
# Upgrading any of these requires testing:
#   - Zig: build.zig API changes (0.14→0.15 broke addSharedLibrary)
#   - Idris2: ABI proof syntax may change
#   - OCaml: dune build compatibility
#   - Julia: legacy component only
#
# Chapel is NOT managed by asdf — it's system-installed via rpm.
# Current tested version: 2.7.0
